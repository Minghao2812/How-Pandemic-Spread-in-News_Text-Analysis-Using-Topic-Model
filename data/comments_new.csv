As long as a cap on public debt remains, especially if China's central government still refuses to incur more debts herself by deficit-spending much more than before, China's economic growth rate will continue to fall, and the country will remain vulnerable to shocks.                 --                 This above analysis is also true for Hong Kong, and for that matter for any other country under the sun.",2020-04-22T10:45:47+08:00,3080931,False,2020-05-19

ria,"Correction: Most non-Japanese owners are NORTH koreans and some Chinese immigrants. North Korean owners sent hundreds of millions of dollars to North Korea at the industry's height in the 1990s. Also, until very recently, the pachinko parlor's cash exchange has been controlled by Japan's Yakuza Mafia.During colonial rule, many Chinese and Koreans had sought employment or were forced laborers in Japan, and hundreds of thousands faced isolating discrimination when the war ended. The reason many of such immigrants ended up running pachinko parlours is because they weren't able to get jobs anywhere else (they were discriminated and no one would hire them based on nationality), so it became a place of employment for people who could not achieve regular goals like being a being a truck driver or a teacher due to discrimination. (men immigrants worked at pachinko, women immigrants worked at restaurants)You see, Japan still has no national law against racial discrimination, remaining the ONLY major industrialised society without one. Even government mechanisms ostensibly charged with redressing discrimination have no enforcement power.

Also, until very recently, the pachinko parlor's cash exchange has been controlled by Japan's Yakuza Mafia.During colonial rule, many Chinese and Koreans had sought employment or were forced laborers in Japan, and hundreds of thousands faced isolating discrimination when the war ended. The reason many of such immigrants ended up running pachinko parlours is because they weren't able to get jobs anywhere else (they were discriminated and no one would hire them based on nationality), so it became a place of employment for people who could not achieve regular goals like being a being a truck driver or a teacher due to discrimination. (men immigrants worked at pachinko, women immigrants worked at restaurants)You see, Japan still has no national law against racial discrimination, remaining the ONLY major industrialised society without one. Even government mechanisms ostensibly charged with redressing discrimination have no enforcement power.

He likes to blame the people, who accused China covering up the Wuhan Pneumonia causing this global disaster, by describing that they are politicizing the disaster, see, in fact, he is exactly the one who is politicizing, so, he did not alert the world in time!Cleverly, he step down himself, otherwise the global will pull him down and investigate if any corruption involved.",2020-04-17T01:46:23+08:00,3080100,False,2020-05-19

Well, the new funds so raised should be used mainly for the country's real economy, because banks could simply invent the money through ""creative accounting"" that is then used to increase their capital.                 ---                 This is what Barclays Bank did in 2008, in order to avoid the use of tax money to shore up the bank's capital: Barclays ‘raised’ £5.8 bn in new equity from Gulf sovereign wealth investors — by, it has transpired, lending them the money!                 Barclays implemented a standard loan operation, thus inventing the £5.8 bn deposit ‘lent’ to the investor.

Nevertheless, as soon as human-to-human transmissions were confirmed, massive lockdown and drastic actions were taken. The Anti-China media intentionally miss this important detail.                 Why, when China has been getting the virus under control, has there been such a catastrophic failure in the US? The reason in large part is instead of spending the last two months learning the positive lessons of China's ability to control the virus, the U.S. government spend it on smearing and mocking China. The bitter truth is that the anti-China propaganda campaign has contributed to the US being vain and negligent to the looming crisis and are now facing a medical, human and economic disaster.","No matter what the anti-China people say, the FACT is there is consensus among all public health experts: China offers hope that the global outbreak can be controlled, but drastic measures may be required.

Rex,"Oh, China would LOVE for something like this to be true, but even if it was, it doesn’t excuse the fact that the CCP actively suppressed and censored the sharing of information that could have prevented a LOT of the damage they’re now largely responsible for unleashing upon the world. Calling this a ‘Chinese virus’ and potentially endangering Chinese (and Asians) around the world is despicable, but holding the vile, unsustainable Chinese Communist Party accountable for this pandemic is absolutely fair game. Arresting and silencing (!) doctors, for starters, who were only trying to get ahead of an outbreak, and then LYING about the severity of the virus was tantamount to making Wuhan ground zero. Which is exactly what it was. A few upset tummies in another country is not evidence that the virus was imported.","Oh, China would LOVE for something like this to be true, but even if it was, it doesn’t excuse the fact that the CCP actively suppressed and censored the sharing of information that could have prevented a LOT of the damage they’re now largely responsible for unleashing upon the world.

I wish reporters can tell both sides of the story instead of adding to the negative and never reporting on the positive but I guess scared people read more news,The funny thing about reading all media coverage is how bad they say this virus is but Infact it has killed less than SARS and less than even car accidents and most people recovered. 85% inflected gets a mild flu like symptoms like a fever and a sore throat and after a few days they recovered.

I am reminded of Imagination Technologies brought to the brink of bankruptcy by Apple and now attempting to politically forestall Chinese board representation.                 Collapsing economies present a global bountiful opportunity for cheap technological acquisition.                  Similarly with MotoSich, the Ukrainians would in the light of western economic difficulties act more in Ukraine’s narrow interest than in the prospect of economic carrots from the West.                 ASML the semi-conductor EUV machine manufacturer currently riding high with a packed order book would soon find its order book reflecting the realities of falling consumer demand as the economic effects cascade from falling demand for computer,mobile phones and consumer electronics to falling demand for semi-conductor chips and subsequently to the multimillion dollar semi conductor fabricating EUV machines.                 There is opportunity in a crisis, that serves strategic long term economic objectives. Of course, the US, UK  and other western countries would seek to maintain anti China technology barriers",2020-04-27T22:28:33+08:00,3081672,False,2020-05-19

Raja Kanthan,"With nearly half of all Covid-19 cases in HK coming from travellers from the UK and the US, it is puzzling that the HK government picks on South Asian and South African returnees for pariah treatment instead.  If testing level is the criterion why isn't Japan included given (acc the John's Hopkins site) Japan has done far less testing per pop than SA and not much more than India, per pop?

[email protected]******,"There are many problems with India not being able to replace China as a manufacturing base and one of them is that India does not have a HK or Taiwan where the economy is wealthy and dominated ethnic Indians.  The main reason for China’s rise, in particular the southern coastal regions, is largely due to investments from HK and Taiwanese businessmen in the 1980s and 1990s by setting production lines in the Pearl and Yangtze Delta regions.

Trump impose tariff all over again is reasonable. I believe China is aware of it. So if they forfeit on the deal they are prepared for any consequences. No need to tell China anything. Besides, they will certainly want to carry out the deal. They are buying what they need. With the shortage of resources going around these days. I believe they will be storing those up.

J.C. H,"There are two basic ways to combat a virus, herd immunity, which with humans virtually requires a vaccine, and eradication, which can be done with or without a vaccine. China elected to eradicate SARS-CoV-2. South Korea and New Zealand have joined them. The west has most definitely embraced heard immunity. All of them. Flattening the curve is still herd immunity.
